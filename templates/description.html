<p>Forecasting is an important approach to plan the future effectively and efficiently. The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities, along with certain attributes of each product and store. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast the sales of each product at a particular store, with the aim of making better business decisions based on accurate forecasts.</p>
<p>Using this model, participants are expected to predict the optimal store set-up that would maximize product sales. By understanding the effects of product attributes, the properties of products, store location, and outlet type, which play a key role in increasing sales.</p>
<p>The dataset provided for the challenge consists of 14204 samples, with two files: <strong>'train_data.csv'</strong> with 11363 training examples that have target variables and <strong>'test_data.csv'</strong> with 2841 test examples that have hidden target variables. There is also a file named <strong>'Variable Description'</strong> that describes the variables used in the dataset. You can get all the data <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B0rYHVZftude5m_9BkVCC-quFcxDg7wW?usp=share_link">HERE.</a></p>
