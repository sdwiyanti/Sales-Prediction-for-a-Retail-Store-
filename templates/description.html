<p>Forecasting is an important approach to plan the future effectively and efficiently. The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Accurate forecasts may lead to better decisions in business.</p>
<p>Using this model, we will predict the optimal store set-up that would maximize product sales. By understanding the effects of product attributes, the properties of products, store location, and outlet type, which play a key role in increasing sales.</p>
