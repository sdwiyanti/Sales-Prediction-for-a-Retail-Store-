<p>Submissions are evaluated on the <b>Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-Squared,</b> and <b>Explained Variance Score (EVS)</b> between their predicted number of sales and the actual data. The target variable, called <b>Item_Outlet_Sales</b> in the training set, is the number of sales for an item.</p>
<p>The overal score for this competition is the <b>Weighted Average</b>. The WA is calculated on the sum of 20% MAE, 30% MSE, 30% RMSE, 10% R2 and 10% EVS. A different weights assigned to each metric to achieve the best overall performance. The top of the leaderboard is selected based on the lowest WA score, as a lower WA score indicates better performance of the model.</p>
